# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...
Even if the spelling of it seems a little long
It makes you feel much better and just a little strong
The C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
We never said that it wouldn't have some sort of gong
*Lound Gong sound*
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
